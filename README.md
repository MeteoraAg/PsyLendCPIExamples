## White Hats and Bug Bounty Hunters

See our <a href="https://docs.psyoptions.io/psy-dao-bug-bounty">bug bouny policy</a>. Note that the PsyLend
protocol is in scope, however the CPI library is not, as this is only a set of examples. Feel free
to use the CPI library to look for vulnerabilities in PsyLend.
